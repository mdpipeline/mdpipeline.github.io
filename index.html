<h1>MDpipeline</h1>
<p>The MDpipeline is a developmental project for a large scale high-throughput in silico drug assay. The pipeline uses multi-resolution simulation methodologies to explicitly include drug environments; traversing from the chemoinformatics and QM level to atomistic and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations.</p>
<p>The pipeline webpage is currently under construction and will be updated shortly.</p>
